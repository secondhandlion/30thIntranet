			<p>How long can two people talk about nothing? We have a saboteur aboard. I can't. As much as I care about you, 
				my first duty is to the ship. Fear is the true enemy, the only enemy. Maybe if we felt any human loss as keenly 
				as we feel one of those close to us, human history would be far less bloody. Now we know what they mean by 
				'advanced' tactical training. They were just sucked into space. You enjoyed that. The Federation's gone; the 
				Borg is everywhere! I will obey your orders. I will serve this ship as First Officer. And in an attack against 
				the Enterprise, I will die with this crew. But I will not break my oath of loyalty to Starfleet. I'd like to 
				think that I haven't changed those things, sir. Talk about going nowhere fast. This should be interesting. 
				Your head is not an artifact!</p>
